---
I design machine learning and generative AI solutions that convert business problems into decision-ready outputs.
My work begins with understanding business context and decision needs, followed by building end-to-end ML and LLM workflows from data ingestion to insight delivery.
I prioritize system design over isolated models, ensuring components work together to produce reliable and explainable results.
My experience includes predictive analytics, NLP, retrieval-augmented generation, and LLM-based applications built for scalability and clarity.
Currently expanding expertise in agent-based AI and MLOps to build AI systems that create measurable business impact.
